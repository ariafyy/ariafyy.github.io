I have a B.Eng. and a M.Eng. in the field of ME. I have several years of work experience in AI, specializing in LLMs, Language Agents and Multimodality.

Currently, I lead an exciting Multimodal Metahuman Project, specifically focusing on LLMs and Multimodality. I firmly believe that Embodied AI will shape the future.
